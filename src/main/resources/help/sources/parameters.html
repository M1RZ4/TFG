	<h1>Perform an experimental analysis by parameters</h1>
	<p>
	<p>Once you access the experimental analysis dialog, to perform
		such analysis by parameters there's no specififc condition required
		and it can be done specifying the following parameters:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Number of tasks instance will have</li>
		<li>Maximum capacity that can be reached by the capacity
			intervals of the instance</li>
		<li>Number of instances to generate for the analysis</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Once you have chosen the required parameters, you only have to
		click the Save button at the bottom of the dialog.</p>

	<p>Once the analysis is processed (it may take a few seconds, based
		on the number of combinations), a dialog will be displayed where you
		can navigate through your folders to choose the name of the file to
		save (it's not required to specify the extension, the system will
		automatically add the xls extension to the file). Generated file can
		be opened with any software that supports xls.</p>
