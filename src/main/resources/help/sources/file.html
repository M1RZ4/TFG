	<h1>Perform an experimental analysis from file</h1>
	<p>Once you access the experimental analysis dialog, to perform
		such analysis from file is neccesary to have a file with this format:</p>
	<div id="format">
		<p>N:X</p>
		<p>T:Y0,Y1,Y2</p>
		<p>C:Z0,Z1,Z2</p>
	</div>
	<p>Each line represents a parameter for the analysis performance,
		followed by : and one or more numbers separated with ,:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>N is the number of instances and it's a possitive number (X)</li>
		<li>T is the number of tasks for each instance and is's a list of
			possitive numbers (Y0, Y1, Y2)</li>
		<li>C is the maximum capacity for each instance and it's a list
			of numbers greater than 3 (Z0, Z1, Z2)</li>
	</ul>
	<p>One you have an analysis file, you only have to click the Load
		button at the bottom of the dialog.</p>
	<p></p>

	<p>Once you access the option, a dialog is displayed where you can
		navigate through your folders to choose which file you want to load in
		different ways:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Writing the name of the file to load</li>
		<li>Selecting manually the file to load</li>
	</ul>
	<p></p>

	<p>if the chosen file doesn't exist, has an invalid extension
		(different from txt) or has an invalid format, the system will warn
		the user:</p>

	<p>Once the analysis is loaded, it will be processed (it may take a
		few seconds, based on the number of combinations) and, when finished,
		a dialog will be displayed where you can navigate through your folders
		to choose the name of the file to save (it's not required to specify
		the extension, the system will automatically add the xls extension to
		the file). Generated file can be opened with any software that
		supports xls.</p>
