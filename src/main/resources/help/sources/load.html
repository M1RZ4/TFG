	<h1>Load instances</h1>
	<p>To load an instance it's neccesary to have an file with this
		format:</p>
	<div id=format>
		<p>
			<strong>NOP</strong>: number of tasks
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong>NINT</strong>: number of intervals
		</p>
		<p>NINT lines, each one with three integers: [IntervalStart
			IntervalEnd IntervalCapacity] (300000 in IntervalEnd means infinite)</p>
		<p>NOP lines, each one with three integers: [TaskIndex
			TaskDuration TaskDueDate]</p>
	</div>
	<p>Once you have a file, instance load can be accessed in different
		ways:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Using menu option File > Load</li>
		<li>Using shortcut Ctrl+O</li>
		<li>Using the Load button in the bottom left corner of the main
			window</li>
	</ul>
	<p>You can also modify the numeric value specified next to the
		Separation between marks label to choose which separation between
		graduation marks you want to display as you load the instance.</p>

	<p>Once you access the option, a dialog is displayed where you can
		navigate through your folders to choose which file you want to load in
		different ways:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Writing the name of the file to load</li>
		<li>Selecting manually the file to load</li>
	</ul>
	<p></p>

	<p>If the chosen file doesn't exist or has an invalid extension
		(different from txt) the system will warn the user:</p>
	<p></p>

	<p>If the file exists and has a valid extension, but it has wrong
		format, the system will not warn the user, but the instance won't be
		loaded.</p>
	<p>If the instance is succesfully loaded, it will be displayed in
		the main window:</p>
