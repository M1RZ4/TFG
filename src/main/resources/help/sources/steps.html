	<h1>Schedule instances step by step</h1>
	<p>To perform a step by step scheduling you can use the Previous
		and Next buttons at the bottom of the main window, and select a rule
		in the drop-down, marked with the Rule label at the left bottom corner
		of the window.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>If you use the Next button the scheduling will be performed
			with all the scheduled tasks plus the next task got by the chosen
			rule. This button is default enabled and it only gets disabled when
			you get a full scheduling</li>
		<li>If you use the Previous button the scheduling will be
			performed with all the scheduled tasks minus the last task got by the
			chosen rule. This button is default disbaled and it only gets enabled
			when you click the Next or Final buttons at least once. The button
			gets disabled when you get an unscheduled instance</li>
	</ul>
	<p>The option to modify the g parameter is only enabled when the
		chosen rule is ATC, and it allows you to chose values between 0.01 and
		1.</p>
	<p>You can also modify the numeric value specified next to the
		Separation between marks label to choose which separation between
		graduation marks you want to display as you schedule the instance.</p>
	<p></p>

	<p>Everytime a new task is scheduled the tardiness value, displayed
		at the bottom right corner of the main window, will be updated.</p>
