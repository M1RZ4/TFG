	<h1>Schedule instaces manually</h1>
	<p>
		To perform a manual scheduling is neccesary to acces the <a
			href="tasks.html">tasks table</a> and that there's no scheduled
		instance (neither partial of fully) in the application at that moment.
		If there's any active scheduling the manual scheduling option will be
		disabled.
	</p>
	<p>Once in the right dialog and fulfilling the previous condition,
		to perform this scheduling it's neccesary to select the row for the
		tasks you want to schedule and click at the Schedule button at the
		bottom of the table.</p>
	<p>You can also modify the numeric value specified next to the
		Separation between marks label to choose which separation between
		graduation marks you want to display as you schedule the instance.</p>
	<p></p>

	<p>Everytime a new task is scheduled the tardiness value, displayed
		at the bottom right corner of the main window, will be updated.</p>
	<p>If there's no selected row or the selected task has already been
		scheduled the system will warn the user.</p>
